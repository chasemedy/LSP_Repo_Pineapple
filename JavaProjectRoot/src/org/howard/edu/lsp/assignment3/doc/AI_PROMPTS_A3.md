* AI Usage (brief):
 * - Used a generative assistant to find small ways to make A2 more OO without over-engineering.
 *   Basic example adopted: split CSV I/O into a CsvIO class and apply rules via a simple Transformer list (Strategy) in the same order.
 * - Also grabbed one quick tip: set Eclipse Run Config “Working directory” to the project root so ./data paths resolve.
 * Implementation/testing by me; outputs match A2 (including empty/missing input).
