/*
 * AI Usage Reflection:
 * I used ChatGPT to help me understand how abstract classes and interfaces 
 * can work together in Java. It helped me verify that my subclasses were 
 * properly calling super(id, location) and implementing getStatus() correctly. 
 * I still wrote and tested the code myself to make sure it ran exactly as the 
 * provided Main.java required.
