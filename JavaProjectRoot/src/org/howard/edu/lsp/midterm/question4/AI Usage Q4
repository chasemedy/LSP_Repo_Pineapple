AI Usage Reflection:
  I used ChatGPT to help me understand how abstract classes and interfaces 
  can work together in Java. It helped me verify that my subclasses were 
  properly calling super(id, location) and implementing getStatus() correctly. 
  I still wrote and tested the code myself to make sure it ran exactly as the 
  provided Main.java required.
 
AI Excerpt: Abstract classes serve as blueprints for other classes. 
 They define common attributes and methods that all subclasses share, 
 but can also include abstract methods that each subclass must implement in 
 its own way. In this project, the Device class is abstract because it provides shared
 properties like id, location, and heartbeat, while leaving getStatus() abstract so
 each specific device type (like DoorLock, Camera, or Thermostat) can define how
 it reports its own status.
